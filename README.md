# FR : Outil de simulation minimal des interactions entre usagers de la route
# EN : Minimal Simulation tool of road users' interactions


This project is thedevelopement of a simulation tool in order to proceed to road safety analysis as part of Lionel Nébot Janvier's master's project at École Polytechnique Montréal under the supervision of Professor Nicolas Saunier 

The project is still under development: the code's structure is not permanent !

This repository contains the files the user needs to proceed to computation and also analysis.
